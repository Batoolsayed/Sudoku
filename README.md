# discretion the game :

- But the right number that make line and the squ that have num from 1 to 9 without  repeat.


 #### * not repeat the num in the 
 - columns
 - rows 
 - squ 3*3



## how I will do the game:

- use the array, board without answer:

board ={
    [5,7,2,9,1,3,6,8,4],
    [8,6,1,4,2,7,9,3,5],
    [9,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,8,0,6,0,2],
    [5,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,1],
    [7,0,6,0,9,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,6],
    [8,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0], 
    [1,0,0,0,0,9,5,7,0]
}
 

- make nested loop to catch all number in array 

* take the number form the board and put this number in the sq without 0 value and if 0 put function click and choose the number from card under the board. 

* and chick the number from board  if = to the answer .....correct 
  - and make function check if the board is full ....win 
  - sound  
* and if wrong .....print wrong  and count 

- if I click in the number change the color
